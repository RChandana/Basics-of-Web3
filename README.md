# Basics-of-Web3

## Before Web3

The first version of the Internet – **known as Web 1** – arrived in the late 1990s and comprised a collection of links and homepages. 
Websites weren’t particularly interactive. You couldn’t do much apart from read things and publish basic content for others to read.


**Web 2** came next. Some people call this the “read/write” version of the internet, in reference to a computer code that lets you both open and edit files rather than just view them. 
This version of the Internet allowed people to not only consume content, but create their own and publish it on blogs like Tumblr, Internet forums and marketplaces like Craigslist. 
Later, the emergence of social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram took content sharing to new heights.


Although Web 2 has brought the world amazing free services, a lot of people have grown tired of the new “walled gardens” these huge tech companies have created and want to have more control over their data and content. This is where Web 3 comes in.

Web 3 can be understood as the “read/write/own” phase of the Internet.
Rather than just using free tech platforms in exchange for our data, users can participate in the governance and operation of the protocols themselves. 
This means people can become participants and shareholders, not just customers or products.
